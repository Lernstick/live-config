1. Regressions

Everything that worked with live-initramfs works with live-boot/live-config,
except for the following things:

  * temporarily no serial console support during booting. this will be added
    back in some time.
  * the locale script temporarily doesn't automatically configures the keyboard
    when a 'short' locale is specified (like locales=de).
  * not exactely a regression, but some boot parameters did change, have a look
    at the manpage of live-config.


2. Todo items

  * makeing plugins infrastructure self-contained
  * making plugins post- and pre- login processing
  * verify modifications with a d-i sample installation.
  * allow some scripts (most prominently locales) to be run even in persistent mode.
  * use verbose/quiet/interactive modes for scripts.
  * use logfile.
  * enable display managers only if they are the selected one.
  * add option to specify the xsession.
  * when not using persistency, do not import options into the debconf db.
  * cleanup the scripts order and splitting.
  * check if we have the most important scripts for ubuntu so that live-config supports both.
